# To-Do List


## What will the application do? 

The To-Do list application will allow users to keep track of things to do, mark task that are completed, and highlight
overdue tasks. Users will also be able to assign priority to tasks which will change the way they are displayed.

## Who will use it?
 
People who have trouble keeping track of tasks and needs help organizing their schedule.

## Why is this project of interest to me?

As the semester progresses, it is getting more difficult to keep track of the many deadlines and examination dates from
different courses which are all located in different areas. Having an application to help **consolidate all these dates 
into one location** would be extremely helpful and helps **reduce the stress of managing deadlines**.
